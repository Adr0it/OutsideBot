Say hello to OutsideBot, a bot that keeps track of members' availability to go outside during the current week. When a certain number of members are available for a day, the bot schedules a meeting. Details for the meeting are provided, including a weather report.

In this project, I got the chance to learn more about databases, dates, times (the UTC standard), asyncronous scheduling of functions, the Discord API, the National Weather Service forecasting API, and the geopy library (to convert locations into latitudes and longitudes to fetch weather for)/
